# Scrabble
The game Scrabble.  
  
## Download and Install  
Download the program specific to your OS from [here](https://github.com/Lord-of-the-Galaxy/Scrabble/releases/tag/v0.1.0b), extract the .zip file and run Scrabble.exe.  
  
I'll be writing an installer for Scrabble once the project itself reaches a stable state. 
  
## Bugs?  
This project is in its early developmental stage, so bugs are sure to exist. Please report bugs [here](https://github.com/Lord-of-the-Galaxy/Scrabble/issues).  
  
## Processing  
This game has been built using [Processing](https://processing.org/), a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. (SRC - [processing.org](https://processing.org/))
